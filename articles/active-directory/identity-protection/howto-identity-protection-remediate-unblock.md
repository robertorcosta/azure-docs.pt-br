# <a name="remediate-risks-and-unblock-users"></a>Remediate risks and unblock users

After completing your [investigation](howto-identity-protection-investigate-risk.md), you will want to take action to remediate the risk or unblock users. Organizations also have the option to enable automated remediation using their [risk policies](howto-identity-protection-configure-risk-policies.md). Organizations should try to close all risk detections that they are presented with in a time period your organization is comfortable with. Microsoft recommends closing events as soon as possible because time matters when working with risk.

## <a name="remediation"></a>Correção

All active risk detections contribute to the calculation of a value called user risk level. O nível de risco do usuário é um indicador (baixo, médio, alto) para a probabilidade de que uma conta tenha sido comprometida. As an administrator, you want to get all risk detections closed, so that the affected users are no longer at risk.

Some risks detections may be marked by Identity Protection as "Closed (system)" because the events were no longer determined to be risky.

Administrators have the following options to remediate:

- Self-remediation with risk policy
- Redefinição de senha manual
- Ignorar o risco de usuário
- Close individual risk detections manually

### <a name="self-remediation-with-risk-policy"></a>Self-remediation with risk policy

If you allow users to self-remediate, with Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and self-service password reset (SSPR) in your risk policies, they can unblock themselves when risk is detected. These detections are then considered closed. Users must have previously registered for Azure MFA and SSPR in order to use when risk is detected.

Some detections may not raise risk to the level where a user self-remediation would be required but administrators should still evaluate these detections. Administrators may determine that additional measures are necessary like [blocking access from locations](../conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-location.md) or lowering the acceptable risk in their policies.

### <a name="manual-password-reset"></a>Redefinição de senha manual

If requiring a password reset using a user risk policy is not an option, administrators can close all risk detections for a user with a manual password reset.

Administrators are given two options when resetting a password for their users:

- **Gerar uma senha temporária** – ao gerar uma senha temporária, você pode imediatamente deixar uma identidade em um estado seguro novamente. This method requires contacting the affected users because they need to know what the temporary password is. Because the password is temporary, the user is prompted to change the password to something new during the next sign-in.

- **Exigir que o usuário redefina a senha** – exigir que os usuários redefinam senhas permite a autorrecuperação sem entrar em contato com o suporte técnico nem com o administrador. This method only applies to users that are registered for Azure MFA and SSPR. For users that have not been registered, this option isn't available.

### <a name="dismiss-user-risk"></a>Ignorar o risco de usuário

If a password reset is not an option for you, because for example the user has been deleted, you can choose to dismiss user risk detections.

When you click **Dismiss user risk**, all events are closed and the affected user is no longer at risk. No entanto, como esse método não tem um impacto sobre a senha existente, ele não deixa a identidade relacionada em um estado seguro novamente. 

### <a name="close-individual-risk-detections-manually"></a>Close individual risk detections manually

You can close individual risk detections manually. By closing risk detections manually, you can lower the user risk level. Typically, risk detections are closed manually in response to a related investigation. For example, when talking to a user reveals that an active risk detection is not required anymore. 
 
When closing risk detections manually, you can choose to take any of the following actions to change the status of a risk detection:

- Confirm user compromised
- Ignorar o risco de usuário
- Confirm sign-in safe
- Confirm sign-in compromised

## <a name="unblocking-users"></a>Unblocking users

An administrator may choose to block a sign-in based on their risk policy or investigations. A block may occur based on either sign-in or user risk.

### <a name="unblocking-based-on-user-risk"></a>Unblocking based on user risk

To unblock an account blocked due to user risk, administrators have the following options:

1. **Redefinir senha** - você pode redefinir a senha do usuário.
1. **Dismiss user risk** - The user risk policy blocks a user if the configured user risk level for blocking access has been reached. You can reduce a user's risk level by dismissing user risk or manually closing reported risk detections.
1. **Exclude the user from policy** - If you think that the current configuration of your sign-in policy is causing issues for specific users, you can exclude the users from it. For more information, see the section Exclusions in the article [How To: Configure and enable risk policies](howto-identity-protection-configure-risk-policies.md#exclusions).
1. **Desabilitar política** - se você achar que sua configuração de política está causando problemas para todos os usuários, poderá desabilitar a política. For more information, see the article [How To: Configure and enable risk policies](howto-identity-protection-configure-risk-policies.md).

### <a name="unblocking-based-on-sign-in-risk"></a>Unblocking based on sign-in risk

To unblock an account based on sign-in risk, administrators have the following options:

1. **Entrada de um local ou dispositivo familiar** – uma razão comum para entradas suspeitas bloqueadas são as tentativas de entrada de locais ou de dispositivos desconhecidos. Your users can quickly determine whether this reason is the blocking reason by trying to sign-in from a familiar location or device.
1. **Exclude the user from policy** - If you think that the current configuration of your sign-in policy is causing issues for specific users, you can exclude the users from it. For more information, see the section Exclusions in the article [How To: Configure and enable risk policies](howto-identity-protection-configure-risk-policies.md#exclusions).
1. **Desabilitar política** - se você achar que sua configuração de política está causando problemas para todos os usuários, poderá desabilitar a política. For more information, see the article [How To: Configure and enable risk policies](howto-identity-protection-configure-risk-policies.md).
